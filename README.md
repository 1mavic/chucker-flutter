# Chucker Flutter

An HTTP requests inspector inspired by <a href="https://github.com/ChuckerTeam/chucker">Chucker Android</a>

Chucker Flutter inspects the **HTTP(S) requests/responses** triggered by your Flutter App. It works as a **Dio Interceptor** and stores data relatated to network requests and responses on local storage, and providing a UI for inspecting and sharing their content.

Flutter Apps, using Chucker Flutter, show in-app **notifications** which tell the status (e.g. 200, 400, 500 and so) and requested url and upon clicking on details button it navigates to Chucker Flutter main screen. You cannot manipulate Chucker Flutter behaviour using its setting by navigating to Settings page from the menu button of Chucker Flutter main page.

# Getting Started

To use Chucker Flutter you need to add the  **pub spec dependency** to your `pubspec.yaml` file of your flutter app.

Please verify the current latest version of Chucker Flutter so that you can enjoy the latest features.

```yaml
dependencies:
  chucker_flutter: latest-version
```

To make `ChuckerDioInterceptor` work, just add it in your `Dio` object e.g.:

```dart
Dio().interceptors.add(ChuckerDioInterceptor());
```

The very last thing is to connect Chucker Flutter screens to your app. To do so, you only need to add Chucker Flutter's `NavigatorObserver` in your app's `MaterialApp`  e.g.:

```dart
MaterialApp(
      ...,
      navigatorObservers: [ChuckerFlutter.navigatorObserver],
```

**Congratulations!** üéä You are done. Rest on us!

### Hide-Header

It is intended for **use during development**, and not in release builds or other production deployments.

You can redact headers that contain sensitive information by calling `redactHeader(String)` on the `ChuckerInterceptor`.
